# Introduction to Warpfusion

In this session, you'll learn how to utilize Warpfusion to process video-to-video generations. Warpfusion utilizes Stable Diffusion to generate user customized images for each frame. We will be able to control and customize Stable Diffusion with several tools including ControlNet.
